# Bash_Scripts
A collection of bash scripts that I have written, along with some dictionaries I've compiled. My favorite is insult.

These scripts assume that you store all your dictionaries in `/usr/share/dict/`, as I do. Feel free to change the path to fit your personal set-up.
For the record, I store my scripts in `/usr/local/bin`.
